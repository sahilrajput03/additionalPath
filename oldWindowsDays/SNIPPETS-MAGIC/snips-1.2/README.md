````

## Why

I made this because:

 * I want to use the same snippet list across all my editors and IDE software
 * I want an easy and intuitive way to manage my snippets
 * I dont want my snippets in a proprietary format
 * Other third party snippet tools were too bulky and resource intensive
 * It was fun

## Options

Snips.ini the the program folder sets a few options:

    folder=snips        ; The subfolder under snips.exe which contains all the snippets.
    key=^`              ; An autohotkey code that activates the snippets window.
    foldernamesearch    ; Enabling to search both category/folder name and file names

## Snippet Files

All snippets are plain text files stored in the \snips folder under the program binary. One snippet per file. Edit the contents of the \snips folder in the program root to modify your collection. The tree view will mirror your folder structure. Filenames are the Snippet titles displayed in search and tree.

## Position the Cursor

You can tell Snips to position the cursor after inserting the snippet with an optional command code which is placed on the last line of a snippet file: `<<-X`   
Replace X with the number of spaces FROM THE END OF THE FILE to reverse the cursor. 

For example if your snippet file contained the following code:

    #include <>
    <<-2

The <<-2 on the last line of the file tells snips to position the cursor 2 characters from the end of the previous line. Therefore, after the snippet is inserted, the cursor will be positioned between the brackets. `<|>`.

## Default Snippets

I have included some basics to get you started. Please feel free to share any useful default snippets you think other users will appreciate. I prefer a PR on GitHub for your submissions.

## To Do

* Add CTRL+N hotlink to easily create a new snippet under a category (undecided)
* Improve UI [Auto height, better layout & colors, theming?]
* Add more default snippets

## Warranty and Support
