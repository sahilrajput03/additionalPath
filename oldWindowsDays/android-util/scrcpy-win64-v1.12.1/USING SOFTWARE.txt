beware: scrcpy only works when connected with adb provided in the same folder(this vesion of adb is compartible).

1. OPEN CMD IN THIS FOLDER, 2. adb connect 192.168.43.1:5555, 3. scrcpy

There is no visual feedback, a log is printed to the console.

The target directory can be changed on start:

scrcpy --push-target /sdcard/foo/bar/
