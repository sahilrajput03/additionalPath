• This script also does the work for ctrl+u which deletes the entire line, works in mintty, git-bash too.

• I have customised this script for support for ctrl+backspace.(originally it supported for ctrl+w only )
• Also, to make it working with administrator cmd, you need to run it via admin, or BETTER set its compartibility as administrator. Heck, Yess!!

• Do the work in screenshot work too, that's a must to do, otherwise it won't work.

• Ctrl+v will work now!!!!! Yikess!!!
