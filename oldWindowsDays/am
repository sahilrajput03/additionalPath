#Thought the solution would be to use bash syntax to run in inside minnty only. GONNA DO IT SOON.
if [ $# -eq 0 ]
# $# gives us the number of arguments supplied.

#So, above line executes the all the given arguments as the command and always returns false(thats our key), so we use || operator to execute alert on completion. Yikes!!!
