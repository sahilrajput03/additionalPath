#start am.bat $*
#I am using start to run this command in new cmd prompt, coz mintty doesn't show live progress via bat file.
#Thought the solution would be to use bash syntax to run in inside minnty only. GONNA DO IT SOON.
if [ $# -eq 0 ]
# $# gives us the number of arguments supplied.
then
    echo "No arguments supplied"
else
    echo TESTING::Phase- Parameters $*
    $($*) || alert
#So, above line executes the all the given arguemtns as the commadn and always returns false(thats our key), so we use || operator to execute alert on completiong. Yikess!!!
